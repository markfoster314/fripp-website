# fripp-website

**This is my first web dev freelance gig, a website for two fripp island rental properties**

## Installation

Install this starter (assuming Gatsby is installed) by running from your CLI:
<br/>
`gatsby new fripp-website https://github.com/markfoster314/fripp-website`

Run `gatsby develop` in the terminal to start the dev site.

## CSS Grid

The grid on this site was replaced with a custom version, built using CSS Grid. It's a very simple 12 column grid that is disabled on mobile. To start using the grid, wrap the desired items with `grid-wrapper`. Items inside the `grid-wrapper` use the class `col-` followed by a number, which should add up to 12.

Here is an example of using the grid, for a 3 column layout:

```
<div className="grid-wrapper">
    <div className="col-4">
        <p>Content Here</p>
    </div>
    <div className="col-4">
        <p>Content Here</p>
    </div>
    <div className="col-4">
        <p>Content Here</p>
    </div>
</div>
```
